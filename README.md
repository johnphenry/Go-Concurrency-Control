# Go-Concurrency-Control
Controlling thousands of concurrent goroutines which will belong to game objects, rather than looping through objects and calling a non-concurrent update function. Allows for programming game objects each in its own thread, vastly simplifying the process of writing game code without requiring external scripting to do so.
